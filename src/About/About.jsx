          <h1>Who We Are</h1>
          <p>
          We are three passionate book lovers who believe in the transformative power of reading and the strength of community. Our journey began with a shared longing to connect with fellow readers, to learn about the books they love, and to create a space where we can inspire each other through thoughtful book recommendations.

          <p>
            Our journey began with a simple goal: to create a digital home for book lovers. 
            We wanted a place where people could track their reading, leave reviews, and 
            find their next favorite bookâ€”all in one place. That dream is now a reality.
